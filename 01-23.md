# classification x regression

    binary classifier
    multi-class classifier
    multi-label classifier: not mutually exclusive choices
    how we represent classes
    unordered vs ordered classes
    regression = scoring
    fixed output space
    bounded output space (ranges)
    multiple regressions
    vector space
    regression as a classifier
    argmax
    

# linear model

    binary classifier scores: adding up to 1
        now you only need to check a single score for >0.5
    parametric models
        assumptions: when is a model good?
    linear model as a hyperplane
        decision boundary - where is it?
    coefficients
        determine the hyperplane tilt
    bias
        determine the hyperplace lift from origin
    examples of 2-d linear models
    vector representation
        beta / w / theta / alpha / etc
        dot product a \cdot x
        b^t x or x^t b?
    linear model with summation
    linear model with vector notation
    packing up multiple binary classifiers
    optimization = choose beta
    least squares (RSS)
    loss function, visually
    find minimum = set derivatives to zero
    analytical solution to least squares
    visuallizing (again) the decision boundary
    more visual examples
    is a linear model a good model?
