# linear model

    binary classifier scores: adding up to 1
        now you only need to check a single score for >0.5
    parametric models
        assumptions: when is a model good?
    linear model as a hyperplane
        decision boundary - where is it?
    coefficients
        determine the hyperplane tilt
    bias
        determine the hyperplace lift from origin
    examples of 2-d linear models
    vector representation
        beta / w / theta / alpha / etc
        dot product a \cdot x
        b^t x or x^t b?
    linear model with summation
    linear model with vector notation
