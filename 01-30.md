# linear model
03-20

    packing up multiple binary classifiers (matrix notation)
    optimization = choose beta
    least squares (RSS)
    loss function, visually
    find minimum = set derivatives to zero
    analytical solution to least squares
    visuallizing (again) the decision boundary
    more visual examples
    is a linear model a good model?
